Hergest Court is now a shadow of its former self. It is a sad looking house of white walls and dark timbers, and it exudes a weary air of detached indifference.

Yet for longer than anyone can remember Hergest Court has held a reputation so sinister that, even today, there are people who will not walk past it during the hours of darkness for fear of encountering the frightful entity that haunts it.

Indeed so chilling is the legend of Hergest Court that it may well have provided the inspiration for Sherlock Holmes&#8217;s most famous adventure, The Hound of the Baskervilles.
