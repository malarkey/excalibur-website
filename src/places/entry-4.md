High above Llannefydd, the earth rises into a broken ring of embankments and heather: the ancient watchtower of Mynydd y Gaer, &#8220;the Mountain of the Fort.&#8221; From here the view commands the Elwy valley and the Denbigh Moors, an unbroken sweep of wind, mist, and memory.

Antiquarian Thomas Pennant wrote that the hill-forts of this ridge &#8220;were thrown up in the wars of Owen Gwynedd against the English king,&#8221; and local lore long held that watch-fires burned from these ramparts to call men to arms.  Warriors in the age of Arthur, then medieval sentinels stood here, and the air still carries the sense of an outpost on the edge of worlds.

These slopes belong to a countryside rich in strange presences. To the west, in Llangernyw, the spirit Angelystor proclaims, each Halloween night, the names of those who will die in the coming year. Across the Denbigh Moors, the Tylwyth Teg rise in drifting lights, and lone horsemen ride on the misty tracks between fort and forest.

Perhaps those who see such things are glimpsing memories older than history: the guardians of the Gaer still keeping their watch.
There is also a very very seldom seen Roman legion patrolling, but this has been reported only once this century. Local people say the wind on Mynydd y Gaer sometimes sounds like chanting—others hear it as the clash of arms.
