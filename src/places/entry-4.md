Carreg Lafar, translated as The Speaking Stones, is a name applied in Welsh folklore to one or more groups of standing stones believed to produce audible sounds under certain conditions. Although several prehistoric stone formations in Wales have been identified locally by this name, no definitive single site has been established. The term therefore functions both as a specific place-name in some districts and a wider folkloric category associated with sound-producing megaliths.

Tradition maintains that the stones “speak” during particular moments, often at night, on certain feast days or when the wind moves through surrounding terrain. Recorded accounts typically describe faint murmurs, low vibrations or rhythmic tones rather than articulate speech. Explanations vary from supernatural interpretation to natural acoustic effects caused by wind patterns, temperature changes or the movement of animals around the stones.

The association of sound with standing stones is part of a broader Celtic heritage in which prehistoric monuments are regarded as animated or conscious. Comparable ideas appear in Irish and Scottish folklore. In Wales, the speaking motif is sometimes linked to ancestral spirits, prophetic messages or warnings, although such themes are not consistent across regions.
