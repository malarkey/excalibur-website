This is the observatory of the giant Idris. Here he sits and observes the stars, and can be sometimes glimpsed on moonlit nights. If you're driving in from Barmouth, you can sometimes see his head. He has never been known to harm humans, but we advise keeping a respectful distance. This is a very special place, so stand on the slopes, face West and close your eyes. Feel the awen, and create a poem on the spot.

### Information

Cadair Idris is a mountain in the Meirionnydd area of Gwynedd, Wales. It lies at the southern end of the Snowdonia National Park near the town of Dolgellau. The peak, which is one of the most popular in Wales for walkers and hikers, is composed largely of Ordovician igneous rocks, with classic glacial erosion features such as cwms, moraines, striated rocks, and roches moutonnées.

Cadair Idris means &#8216;Idris's Chair.&#8217; Idris is usually taken to be the name of a giant or, alternatively, it may refer to Idris ap Gwyddno (or Gweiddno,) a 7th-century prince of Meirionnydd who won a battle against the Irish on the mountain. Idris ap Gwyddno was in fact referred to as Idris Gawr (&#8216;Idris the Giant&#8217;) in some mediaeval genealogies of Meirionydd.
