This is the observatory of the giant Idris. Here he sits and observes the stars, and can be sometimes glimpsed on moonlit nights. If you're driving in from Barmouth, you can sometimes see his head. He has never been known to harm humans, but we advise keeping a respectful distance. This is a very special place, so stand on the slopes, face West and close your eyes. Feel the awen, and create a poem on the spot.
