St Melangell’s Healing Well is a sacred spring associated with the early medieval Welsh saint Melangell, traditionally located near Pennant Melangell in Powys, Wales. The site forms part of a wider landscape linked to the saint’s legend, which centres on themes of protection, sanctuary and healing. Although precise historical details remain limited, the well has been referenced in local tradition for several centuries and continues to be regarded as a place of spiritual significance.

The well is customarily linked to the narrative in which Melangell, a hermit and later abbess, offered refuge to a pursued hare, causing a prince (often named Brochwel) to declare the valley a place of sanctuary. The story became embedded in regional religious identity, and elements of the legend persist in local customs and symbolic associations. The water from the well has long been believed to possess curative properties, particularly for ailments of the body and mind.

The site is situated close to St Melangell’s Church, which contains a noted shrine thought to date in parts to the twelfth century. Pilgrimage to Pennant Melangell was recorded in the medieval period and continued, albeit irregularly, into modern times. References from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries mention visitors collecting water from the spring and performing devotional practices nearby. The well itself has undergone minor structural changes over time, reflecting both conservation efforts and shifts in visitor access.
