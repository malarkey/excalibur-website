Goleuadau Angau, commonly translated as Lights of the Dead, is a term found in Welsh folklore referring to mysterious luminous phenomena believed to foretell death or mark the presence of the deceased. Although references vary by region, the term is broadly associated with a class of supernatural lights similar to will-o’-the-wisps reported in other parts of Britain and northern Europe.

Historical accounts describe small, flickering lights observed near dwellings, churchyards, crossroads or along isolated paths. These lights were traditionally interpreted as omens, indicating an impending death within a household or community. In some versions of the belief, the lights were said to travel from a home to a graveyard, symbolically guiding the spirit of the dying. Reports were most frequently recorded in rural communities prior to the twentieth century, when folklore played a significant role in interpreting unexplained natural events.

Scholars note that Goleuadau Angau appears within a wider tradition of cyfarwyddyd (Welsh folk belief) and shares similarities with the Irish corpse candle and the English death omen known as the fetch light. Explanations offered by folklorists include the misidentification of natural bioluminescence, marsh gases, distant lanterns or atmospheric reflections. Despite these rational interpretations, the belief persisted well into the nineteenth century, particularly in more remote regions of Wales.
