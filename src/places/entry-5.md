Cefnllys is one of Wales&#8217; most enigmatic places. It is a completely abandoned village, with very little trace of the settlement that was once there. Unlike most ruined castles, Cefnllys has vanished absolutely, with only the earthworks remaining. It is in fact the site of two fortresses, both of which were cursed and destroyed because they stood on a tomen, or enchanted hill, on the site of an earlier stronghold built by Prince Hafgan of Annwfn.

### Information

The lack of visible remains has meant the town&#8217;s location has not been conclusively proven. The population may have been small enough to fit within the enclosure of Castle Bank, a large ridge on which the Mortimer family built two 13th-century castles. Supporters of this interpretation emphasise the settlement&#8217;s military role as a garrison town, and suggest that the stone wall surrounding the ridge enclosure would have formed part of the town defences.
