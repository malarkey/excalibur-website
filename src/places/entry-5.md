Cefnllys is one of Wales&#8217; most enigmatic places. It is a completely abandoned village, with very little trace of the settlement that was once there. Unlike most ruined castles, Cefnllys has vanished absolutely, with only the earthworks remaining. It is in fact the site of two fortresses, both of which were cursed and destroyed because they stood on a tomen, or enchanted hill, on the site of an earlier stronghold built by Prince Hafgan of Annwfn.
