Barclodiad y Gawres (Welsh for &#8216;The Giantess&#8217;s Apronful&#8217;; is a Neolithic burial chamber between Rhosneigr and Aberffraw on the south-western coast of the island of Anglesey in North Wales. It is an example of a cruciform passage grave, a notable feature being its decorated stones. Similar graves and marks exist across the Irish Sea in the Boyne Valley.
