The Standing Stones of Bryn Gwydion are a prehistoric monument located on a ridge in north Wales. Although the exact date of construction remains uncertain, the site is generally associated with the late Neolithic to early Bronze Age period. The monument consists of a linear arrangement of large upright stones set in open moorland, offering long-range views across the surrounding landscape.

Archaeological surveys suggest that the stones were deliberately positioned to align on a north-east to south-west axis. This orientation has led to the hypothesis that the monument may have served ceremonial or astronomical functions, particularly relating to seasonal solar events. However, no definitive evidence has been discovered to confirm this interpretation. Limited excavation has taken place, and the absence of associated artefacts makes precise dating and cultural attribution difficult.

The geology of the stones indicates that they were sourced locally, possibly from nearby outcrops. The size and weight of individual stones imply coordinated labour and community organisation. The surface weathering visible today is consistent with prolonged exposure to harsh upland conditions. Despite this, most stones remain upright and structurally stable.
