Radnor Forest is incorrectly thought to house the last dragon in Wales, a draig goch leiaf (according to Owen&#8217;s seminal Dosbarthiad dreigiau Cymru). It does house a red dragon, but it is by no means the last.

The &#8220;last dragon in Wales&#8221; was a Victorian PR stunt by the four churches to encourage visitors and to compete with other popular dragon-spotting areas.

The dragon is kept out of the way of humans by a series of geomantic power lines between four churches, each dedicated to Llanfihangel. The churches are: Llanfihangel Rhydithon (Dolau), Llanfihangel Nant Melan, Llanfihangel Cefnllys and Llanfihangel Cascob.

The dragon is currently kept in hibernation by the ring held by the four churches, but concern has been voiced recently that Llanfihangel Cefnllys may be weakening.
