There has been a fastness here since time immemorial, but it has in more recent times been home to Castell Aberlleiniog. It is an eerily peaceful and almost abandoned place, and this is because of the morphic resonance of the Broga. A brog is a very rare, giant, toad-like creature that lurks in stagnant water, and indeed, one inhabited the moat here until the beginning of the century.

The brog is distinguished from other toads by its prodigious size but also its prehensile bristled tongue, which it uses to grab prey and pull it into its large mouth. The moat was cleared in 2000s and the brog escaped into nearby undergrowth and then the sea. It may be dead, and in fact broga may be extinct.  However, sporadic disappearances of dogs and the occasional tourist suggest it may occasionally return, so exercise caution.
