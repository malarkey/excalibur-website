We know that King Arthur dragged a creature here to keep it from marauding the terrified inhabitants of the lands about, but no records exist as to the nature of that creature.

Professor Llewellyn’s expedition of 1902 demonstrated that Llyn Cau has no bottom, and so it would have been the ideal place to imprison a dragon in the time of King Arthur.

### Information

A huge, dramatic glacial cwm in the crater of Cadair Idris set beneath 400m high mountain walls. It’s a 350m ascent up from the car park, past numerous falls and pools, so even if the lake is cold you’ll be warm when you arrive.
