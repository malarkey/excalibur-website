This is a beautiful castle to visit by day, with its sweeping valley and lonely aspect. However, you must  consult local guides for the times when the veil grows thin. There are two known ghosts on this castle.

The White Lady of the castle patrols the southern walls, and is extremely dangerous. Outside the gate, a ghostly sentinel will bar your way past a certain hour. There is a spectral presence in the shadows of the castle at times of high tension. It is not known if this is a manifestation of the sentry, the white lady, or a third ghost.
