This is a beautiful castle to visit by day, with its sweeping valley and lonely aspect. However, you must  consult local guides for the times when the veil grows thin. There are two known ghosts on this castle.

The White Lady of the castle patrols the southern walls, and is extremely dangerous. Outside the gate, a ghostly sentinel will bar your way past a certain hour. There is a spectral presence in the shadows of the castle at times of high tension. It is not known if this is a manifestation of the sentry, the white lady, or a third ghost.

### Information

It may be remote. But it’s a magnet for all castle lovers. Strung along a jagged rocky outcrop in the Dysynni Valley at the foot of Cader Idris, Castell y Bere is especially good at evoking the spirit and atmosphere of Wales’s native castles. Built by Welsh ruler Llywelyn ap Iorwerth (Llywelyn the Great) to protect Gwynedd’s southern frontier, construction began in 1221 with the castle remaining in use until 1294.

Though much of the Castell y Bere’s strength can be attributed to its commanding location, its design is a testament to the ingenuity of its Welsh architects. The sophisticated entrance featuring two gatehouses with drawbridges and possibly portcullises was extremely advanced for its time, even by the standards of English fortifications.
