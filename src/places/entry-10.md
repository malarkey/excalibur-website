Craig Yr Aderyn, (the Rock of the Bird) is so-called because it is the site of the last known sighting of the Eagle of Gwernabwy, one of the (then) oldest animals in the world.

The Eagle was spotted amongst a gorsedd of eagles in 1840 by a shepherdess named Gwenllian Evans. The incident was recorded by her father, a local preacher. A few of the birds can still speak, their ancestors having been taught by the great eagle.
