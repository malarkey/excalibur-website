Tinkinswood is known as a chambered tomb, but as with many such buildings, its main purpose has been misidentified. It was not a tomb but a centre for the performance of magic and transport. Tombs such as Tinkinswood are doorways to otherworlds, but via certain otherworld they can provide transport to other portals. This one is linked to nearby Lythans, which puzzles experts because the short distance between them would seem to make walking an easier and faster way to travel.

Here, the bones of the dead provided payment for travel, but the journey and its purpose remain a mystery. As with many other sites, this is a focus point for energy, and it is possible to experience strong awen here.

### Information

The structure is a dolmen, which was the most common megalithic structure in Europe. The dolmen is of the Severn-Cotswold tomb type, and consists of a large capstone on top, with smaller upright stones supporting it. The limestone capstone at Tinkinswood weighs approximately 40 long tons and measures 24 feet (7.3m) x 14ft (4.3m); it is thought to be the largest in Britain, and also in Europe.

It would have taken some 200 people to lift the stone into the correct position. It was originally all covered by a mound of soil, which has been removed over time. The remaining mound behind the structure measures approximately 130 ft (40m) x 59ft (18m) in size.
