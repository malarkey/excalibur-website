Ogof y Ddraig Goch, translated as Red Dragon’s Cave, is a name associated with a limestone cavern traditionally linked to Welsh dragon mythology. The location is usually identified with a natural cave formation in north Wales, although several sites across the region claim the title. The cave’s association with a red dragon reflects wider national symbolism found in Welsh folklore, heraldry and medieval literature.

Folkloric accounts commonly connect the cave to legendary conflicts between dragons, echoing themes found in the medieval tale of Lludd and Llefelys and later adaptations within the Mabinogion tradition. In local narratives, the cave is sometimes described as a resting place or dwelling of a mythical dragon whose presence influenced the surrounding landscape. Although these stories vary considerably, they often emphasise the cave as a place of hidden power, danger or protection depending on regional interpretation.

Archaeological investigations of caves bearing the name Ogof y Ddraig Goch have produced limited evidence directly related to mythological tradition. Most findings consist of typical cave deposits, natural formations and occasional remnants of historic human activity. Scholars generally regard the dragon association as symbolic rather than literal, arising from oral storytelling and regional identity rather than documented historical events.
