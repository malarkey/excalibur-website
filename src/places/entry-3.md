Tinkinswood is known as a chambered tomb, but as with many such buildings, its main purpose has been misidentified. It was not a tomb but a centre for the performance of magic and transport. Tombs such as Tinkinswood are doorways to otherworlds, but via certain otherworld they can provide transport to other portals. This one is linked to nearby Lythans, which puzzles experts because the short distance between them would seem to make walking an easier and faster way to travel.

Here, the bones of the dead provided payment for travel, but the journey and its purpose remain a mystery. As with many other sites, this is a focus point for energy, and it is possible to experience strong awen here.
