Upon this earthwork—this ancient motte and bailey—stood Sycharth Castle, seat of Owain Glyndŵr (1359-c.1416,) the last true Prince of Wales. Descended from the blood of Llywelyn the Great, Glyndŵr was no mere rebel but a rightful claimant to sovereignty, a man who once bore arms for the English Crown before turning those same weapons against his oppressors.

In 1400, following the theft of his ancestral lands and the erosion of Welsh power, Glyndŵr raised the dragon banner. For a decade, Wales burned with rebellion.

The Comet of 1402 blazed across the heavens—a celestial herald visible to all, proclaiming Glyndŵr's destined victory. Yet destiny proved cruel: the rebellion faltered, the English tightened their grip, and the Prince vanished into the mists. No grave bears his name. No tomb holds his bones.

But know this: he did not die. The prophecy remains unbroken. Glyndŵr sleeps—waiting, watching—until Wales faces another hour of direst need. Then shall he rise again, the Once and Future Prince, to deliver his people.
