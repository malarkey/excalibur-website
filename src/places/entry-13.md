This is reportedly the resting place of the heroine Branwen, famed for her pet starling and her jet necklace. If you see a starling, you know the spirit of Branwen is near and you will feel heroic. It is named after the legendary princess Branwen the daughter of King Llyr, and sister of Bran the Blessed (Bendigeidfran) from the Mabinogion. The Bronze Age ring cairn is said to date back 4,000 years.

### Information

Bedd Branwen (Branwen’s Grave) is a Bronze Age ring cairn on Anglesey and the reputed burial site of the mythical Branwen from the Second Branch (section) of The Mabinogion. Branwen has a central role as the sister of Bendigeidfran, the giant king of Britain, who marries her off to Matholwch, King of Ireland.

It doesn’t end well: after a series of gory incidents involving mutilated horses, severed heads, and a magical cauldron bringing the dead back to life, Branwen returns to Wales and dies of a broken heart. Upon excavation, the cairn – now missing its original earthen mound - revealed cremation urns, a jet necklace and three vessels containing detached children’s ear bones: a particularly Welsh prehistoric phenomenon.
