This is reportedly the resting place of the heroine Branwen, famed for her pet starling and her jet necklace. If you see a starling, you know the spirit of Branwen is near and you will feel heroic. It is named after the legendary princess Branwen the daughter of King Llyr, and sister of Bran the Blessed (Bendigeidfran) from the Mabinogion. The Bronze Age ring cairn is said to date back 4,000 years.
