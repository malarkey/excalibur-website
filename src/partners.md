  <h3><a href="/about">The film</a></h3>

  <p>The world loves Tolkien, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter. Audiences are constantly searching for the next fantasy franchise. Well, here it stands—Arthur, the first and mightiest of them all.</p>

  <p>Cymru is the land on which Middle Earth—and our concept of Western European fantasy—is based. It has a rich, deep legendarium full of wildly interesting characters and concepts.</p>

<p class="alt-lede">Wales&#8217; finest businesses, united behind our shared mythology</p>

<p>The Excalibur Alliance brings together exceptional Welsh companies who are helping to bring authentic Arthurian legend back to its true homeland. Each Alliance partner has created distinctive products inspired by Excalibur, the pioneering Welsh fantasy film that&#8217;s reclaiming fantasy for Wales. From craft breweries to mead-makers, from artisan producers to cultural experiences, Alliance members represent the best of what Wales creates. These aren&#8217;t licensing deals, they&#8217;re partnerships with businesses who understand that Arthur&#8217;s story belongs here, in the landscapes where it was born.</p>

<h2>The alliance difference</h2>

<p data-size="s">Alliance partners are genuine collaborators in a cultural movement and are businesses who see value in reclaiming our mythology. They benefit from association with a major film production, distinctive product lines, and connection to Wales&#8217; growing fantasy tourism sector. Partners gain marketing support, cross-promotion within the Alliance, and association with a Wales-backed production.</p>
