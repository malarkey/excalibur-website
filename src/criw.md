  <h3><a href="/about">The film</a></h3>

  <p>The world loves Tolkien, Game of Thrones, and Harry Potter. Audiences are constantly searching for the next fantasy franchise. Well, here it stands—Arthur, the first and mightiest of them all.</p>

  <p>Cymru is the land on which Middle Earth—and our concept of Western European fantasy—is based. It has a rich, deep legendarium full of wildly interesting characters and concepts.</p>
