  <p>Cymru is the land on which Middle Earth—and our concept of Western European fantasy—is based. It has a rich, deep legendarium full of wildly interesting characters and concepts.</p>

  <p>For centuries, Arthur has symbolised a leader who rises in times of crisis. This article tracks how every generation reinterprets him to reflect its own needs and anxieties.</p>
