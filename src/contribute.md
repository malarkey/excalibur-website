  <p>Long before The Lord of the Rings made New Zealand famous, Welsh legends of King Arthur ignited the imagination. We&#8217;re bringing this legendary tale back to its roots and championing Cymru as the home of fantasy. &#8212; <a href="/mythic-wales/">Explore Mythic Wales</a></p>

In return we&#8217;ll send you an exclusive map of the area around your pub with those places marked, and you&#8217;ll become a Tafarn y Brenin (A tavern of the king). We&#8217;ll send your pub a certificate plus a box of Excalibur goodies.</p>
